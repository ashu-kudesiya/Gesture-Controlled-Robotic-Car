# Gesture-Controlled Robotic Car Project

## Introduction
This project showcases a **Gesture Controlled Robotic Car** designed to navigate and perform actions based on user hand gestures. 

## Features
- Recognizes hand gestures for controlling movement.
- Provides a user-friendly interface for gesture recognition.

## Tools & Technology
1. **Hardware:**
   - Microcontrollers and Processors
   - Sensors
   - Actuators
   - Communication Modules

2. **Software:**
   - Gesture Recognition Algorithms
   - Control Algorithms
   - Operating System
   - Gesture Mapping and Command Logic

## Usage
1. **Starting the Robotic Car:**
   - Connect the hardware components as per the installation instructions.
   - Upload the code to the microcontroller.
2. **Gesture Recognition:**
   - Perform gestures [list gestures and corresponding actions].
3. **Obstacle Avoidance:**
   - The car will automatically detect obstacles and change its path.
4. **Terminating the Program:**
   - Disconnect the power source from the car to stop the program.
