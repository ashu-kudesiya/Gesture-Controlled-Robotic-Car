Gesture-Controlled Robotic Car Project
Introduction
This project showcases a gesture-controlled robotic car designed to navigate and perform actions based on user gestures. The car is built using [mention hardware components] and utilizes [mention technologies used, e.g., Arduino, sensors, motor drivers, etc.].

Features
Recognizes hand gestures for controlling movement.
Implements obstacle detection and avoidance.
Provides a user-friendly interface for gesture recognition.
Installation
Hardware Setup:
[List hardware components and connections required]
Software Installation:
Clone the project repository from [GitHub repository link].
Install the necessary libraries and dependencies [if any].
Usage
Starting the Robotic Car:
Connect the hardware components as per the installation instructions.
Upload the code to the microcontroller.
Gesture Recognition:
Perform gestures [list gestures and corresponding actions].
Obstacle Avoidance:
The car will automatically detect obstacles and change its path.
Terminating the Program:
Disconnect the power source from the car to stop the program.
