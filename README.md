# Gesture-Controlled Robotic Car Project

## Introduction
A ***Gesture Control Robotic Car*** is a cutting-edge and innovative vehicle that can be controlled through hand gestures and motions, typically without the need for physical controllers like joysticks or remote controls.
This technology combines robotics, computer vision, and gesture recognition systems to create a vehicle that responds to human gestures, making it a fascinating and user-friendly device with various applications.
The human hand motions are read by computer camera, this hand gestures or motion are used as data input to control the robotic car.

## Features
- Recognizes hand gestures for controlling movement.
- Provides a user-friendly interface for gesture recognition.
